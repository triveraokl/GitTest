GitTest
=======

I performed a 
git clone git@github.com:triveraokl/GitTest.git
while in the '/Users/trivera/testhub' of my local machine
My local machine prompted me for a password, at then i received the files.
FYI: I was able to modify a file and push up changes with a problem.

I perfomed a
git clone https://github.com/triveraokl/GitTest.git
I am modifying the readme and see if I can push up this change.
